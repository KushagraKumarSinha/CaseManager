# Overview of Project

I spearheaded the creation of a data-centric web-based product search system architecture for an electronic distribution company during my internship. I was able to reduce frontend development time by 55% and maintain 99.9% system uptime. Notably, I implemented SQL Server Database enhancements, streamlining data management for over 1000 items, in addition to designing backend APIs using FastAPI to implement CRUD functionality in the project.
